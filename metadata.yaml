title: 'The displaying of supposed witchcraft : $b Wherein is affirmed that there
  are many sorts of deceivers and impostors, and divers persons under a passive delusion
  of melancholy and fancy. But that there is a corporeal league made betwixt the devil
  and the witch, or that he sucks on the witches body, has carnal copulation, or that
  witches are turned into cats, dogs, raise tempests, or the like, is utterly denied
  and disproved. Wherein also is handled, the existence of angels and spirits, the
  truth of apparitions, the nature of astral and sydereal spirits, the force of charms,
  and philters; with other abstruse matters'
